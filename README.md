An introduction to React

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game made using the tutorial found at: https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe

Learned a lot through this, going to try to make more little projects to keep learning some simple front end stuff. 

Topics touched on through this code:
	state using useState()
	simple lists
	list mapping
	buttons and simple click handlers
	lifting state to a new top level component
	array usage and simple functions e.g. split()
	very very basic css styling
